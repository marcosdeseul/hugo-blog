## What is Homelab?

I have used many public cloud services for a while. Since I started my career as a software engineer, AWS was already running their business. Some old developer folks might not have chance to use public cloud services when landing on their first job, but I was lucky. So I used AWS in my first company. I have used AWS, GCP, Firebase, Parse which was acquired by Facebook and discontinued during most of my careers.

But I always wanted to have my own home data center, which is a homelab. Why? Because instances on public cloud services are already virtualized. I can just rent some computing resources from cloud vendors, but you have no idea of what is happening behind the scene.

I recently joined VMware. What is VMware? VMware is the biggest data center virtualization solution vendor, isn't it? Before joining VMware, I didn't know what products VMware was selling precisely. But I knew the company had a promising vision of hybrid cloud. So I applied for a SE position in VMware and got an offer.

In VMware, it is a paradise to set up a home lab. Many engineers already have experience of building up server clusters and good internal resources. Moreover, these knowledges are relevant to my work to support customers. Then why not?

## How is a home server different from an enterprise one?

A server computer is technically a computer. It also has CPUs, memory cards, storage, and etc. But a server computer has more stuffs compared to a home desktop or a laptop. Server computers usually have multiple CPU sockets and more slots for memory and storage. And power suply is also redundant to prevent power failure. It is also very common that server computers have interactions with each other, so also they usually have multiple ethernet ports.

But do you really need server computers for your own homelab? My answer is NO. If you really want to experience something like ones in a data center, then you should need a server computer for sure. But if you just want to try a similiar set-up at home and to understand the functionality, then you just can go with mini computers. Even with mini computers, you can try most of features of server computers, including setting up a cluster.

## What do you have to consider before buying mini computers for homelab?

## What mini computers do I recommend for your own homelab?
