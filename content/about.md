A solutions and software engineer, currently working for VMware.

I am into Cloud technologies, especially Hybrid Cloud and DevOps:

* Hybrid Cloud & Multi Cloud
* Kubernetes
* CI/CD

## Passionate About Business and Numbers

I have run a couple of businesses when working as a software engineer for 6+ years.

* Online Coding Education Platform
* IT Consulting

And this is why I decided to become a solutions engineer. I always wanted to have a wider view of business, but as a software engineer, I always felt the chance was very limited. I wanted to face customers and to understand why they buy products and how to convince them to choose right ones.

## Passionate About Technologies

As a full-stack software engineer, I did:

* Data Engineering
* Data Visualization
* JS, Scala, Python, Go

I am originally from Korea and currently living in Singapore with my sweet wife and a baby boy ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ If you know how to read Korean, you can find [my articles in Brunch](https://brunch.co.kr/@imagineer) and [my book, "A Historian Became A Devloper"](https://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=14257826).
